# Northcoders News API

## Background

This is an API project I created as part of the Northcoders Bootcamp.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.

2. After cloning, you will need to create two .env files: `.env.test` and `.env.development`. In each .env file, type in `PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>`, with the correct database name for each file. The database names can be found in `setup.sql`.

3. Make sure that the .env files are .gitignored.
